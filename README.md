# pineapple-lang

`pineapple-lang` is an abstract, English-looking programming language for controlling real-time audio. Its purpose is to be suitable for both newcomers to the programmatic and/or musical world, as well as experienced musicians.

## Examples

```
let the key be Am
let the feel be sweeping or intense
alter feel every 18 to 32 bars
play in 5/4 at 132bpm
   but faster when the feel is intense

add üçç to *bass
```
